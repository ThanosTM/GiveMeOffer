### Description
In the game show "The Price is Right", a number of players (typically 4) compete to get on stage by guessing the price of an item. The winner is the person whose guess is the closest one not exceeding the actual price. Because of the popularity of the one-person game show "Who Wants to be a Millionaire",the American Contest Management (ACM) would like to introduce a one-person version of the "The Price is Right". In this version, each contestant is allowed G (1 <= G <= 30) guesses and L (0 <= L <= 30)lifelines. The contestant makes a number of guesses for the actual price. After each guess, the contestant is told whether it is correct, too low, or too high. If the guess is correct, the contestant wins. Otherwise,he uses up a guess. Additionally, if his guess is too high, a lifeline is also lost. The contestant loses when all his guesses are used up or if his guess is too high and he has no lifelines left. All prices are positive integers.

It turns out that for a particular pair of values for G and L, it is possible to obtain a guessing strategy such that if the price is between 1 and N (inclusive) for some N, then the player can guarantee a win.The ACM does not want every contestant to win, so it must ensure that the actual price exceeds N.At the same time, it does not want the game to be too diffcult or there will not be enough winners to attract audience. Thus, it wishes to adjust the values of G and L depending on the actual price. To help them decide the correct values of G and L, the ACM has asked you to solve the following problem.Given G and L, what is the largest value of N such that there is a strategy to win as long as the price is between 1 and N (inclusive)?

### Input
The input consists of a number of cases. Each case is specified by one line containing two integers G and L, separated by one space. The end of input is specified by a line in which G = L = 0.

### Output
For each case, print a line of the form:
Case c: N
where c is the case number (starting from 1) and N is the number computed.

### Sample Input
3 0
3 1
10 5
7 7
0 0

### Sample Output
Case 1: 3
Case 2: 6
Case 3: 847
Case 4: 127


# 递归？
先上我的代码：
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int calc(int G, int L){
    int res = 1;
    if(L == 0)return G-L;
    if(G == 0)return 0;
    res += calc(G-1, L-1);
    res += calc(G-1,L);
    return res;
}

int main(){
    int G, L, n=1;
    while(scanf("%d %d", &G, &L) && (G || L)){
        printf("Case %d: %d\n", n++, calc(G, L));
    }
    return 0;
}
```
想法很简单，先进行一次盲猜calc(G, L)，结果分为以下三种情况：
 - 一次直接猜中;
 - 猜低了，消耗一次猜测机会，下一次猜测时calc(G -1, L);
 - 猜高了，消耗一次猜测机会与一条生命，下一次猜测calc(G - 1, L - 1);
 
 再考虑一下边界情况：
 
 - 当G = 0时，已经不能继续猜测，calc(0, L)  = 0;
 - 当L = 0时，此时虽然可能还拥有猜测机会，但已经不允许再次猜高，采用最保守的猜测方式，calc(G, 0) = G;

虽然给的测试集都通过，但运行结果Time Limit Exceeded 了。发现当输入G=30, L=30时，运行时间已经是相当长了。反思递归的缺点，每次输入一组G,L都要重新计算所有的子问题，因此很耗时。若有一种算法能够将计算过的子问题结果进行保存，下一次直接调用该子问题结果即可而不用继续向下递归，则能够节省大量的时间（以小量的空间资源换取大量的时间开销）

# 动态规划
直接上代码了

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int dp[31][31] = {0};
int main(){
    int G, L, n=1, i, j;
    for(i = 1;i < 31;i++)dp[i][0] = i;
    for(i = 1;i < 31;i++){
        for(j = 1;j < 31;j++){
            if(j <= i)dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
            else dp[i][j] = dp[i][i];
        }
    }
    while(scanf("%d %d", &G, &L) && (G || L)){
        printf("Case %d: %d\n", n++, dp[G][L]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
